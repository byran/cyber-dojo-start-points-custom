The London Underground can be confusing to navigate to newcomers. Create
a system that given a start station and destination station outputs the shortest
journey between the two stations.

Remember the Circle line's route loops whereas all other lines do not.

The shortest journey is defined as:
* Passing through the least number of stations
* Having the least number of train changes

Assumptions:
* The distance between consecutive stations on a line's route is the same
* All trains run the entire length of their respective route (no trains
  terminate before the final station of the route)
