The London Underground can be confusing to navigate to newcomers. Create
a system that given a start station and end station outputs the shortest
route between the two stations.

Remember the Circle line loops whereas all other lines do not.

The shortest route is defined as:
* Passing through the least number of stations
* Having the least number of line changes

Assumptions:
* The distance between consecutive stations on a line is the same
* All trains run the entire length of the line (no trains terminate before
  the final station of the line)
