Write a function to read the acceleration from a
BMA150 accelerometer. The function should indicate
if reading the device fails.

The BMA150 accelerometer is an I2C device.

Its has an address of 0x38.

The acceleration is stored in registers 0x02 to 0x07
as follows:

Register 0x02 - X acceleration
    bit  0 - new data
    bits 1-5 - unused
    bits 6-7 - acceleration lsb

Register 0x03 - X acceleration
    bits 0-8 acceleration msb

Registers 0x04 & 0x05 - Y acceleration
    As per the X acceleration registers

Registers 0x04 & 0x05 - Z acceleration
    As per the X acceleration registers

To read the acceleration you must first write the
register to start reading from and then read the
registers.

To communicate with the device use the following
functions from the HAL:
* HAL_I2C_Master_Transmit
* HAL_I2C_Master_Receive
